# WebsiteBlocker
A simple website blocker. It will ask you for admin privilege when you run the script, simply double click on the py script to run it. Put into the web_site list in the code the websites you wish to block. Facebook is inside the list by default. The script automatically blocks facebook from 0 to 3 am. The script continually runs every 5 seconds or so, it will unblock the website at any other time. "Not working hours" means facebook isnt being blocked, while "working hours" means it is.
